# Bitasmbl-Real-Time-Stock-Heatmap-Dashboard-081b58-

## Description
Build an interactive dashboard that visualizes live stock market performance using a color-coded heatmap. Users can filter sectors, view market movements, and monitor real-time changes as data updates dynamically.

## Tech Stack
- GraphQL
- Objective-C
- Socket.IO

## Requirements
- Fetch real-time and periodically updated stock market data
- Render an interactive heatmap representing stock performance
- Allow users to filter stocks by category, sector, or custom criteria
- Display trend changes with smooth, real-time UI updates
- Handle API rate limits, errors, or missing data gracefully

## Installation
- git clone https://github.com/MrBitasmblTester2/Bitasmbl-Real-Time-Stock-Heatmap-Dashboard-081b58-.git

## Usage
- Build and run the Objective-C app

## Implementation Steps
1. Define GraphQL schema and queries for stock data.
2. Implement Objective-C services to call GraphQL.
3. Integrate Socket.IO for real-time updates.
4. Build Objective-C UI with heatmap and filters.
5. Add error handling and rate limit awareness.
6. Wire real-time updates to smooth UI transitions.
